--Changes--
Altered state to store current set of questions as well as the correct answer as separate arrays

--Next Steps--
Combine the existing event listeners button.rightAnswer and button.wrong so as to compare the selected button to the state object 
--> write a function that evaluates the selection as correct or incorrect
--> this function should cascade into functions that update the state and render changes to the DOM

Alter the button-next-question event listener so that it will initiate a new function 
--> this function should update the state.currentSet and state.currentCorrect depending on state.current
--> put this function within state?
--> use the forEach method to add HTML to currentSet and currentCorrect before concatenating them for display
